```

Usage
-----
There is some developer centric documentation in the [wiki](../../wiki).

Development
-----------
npm scripts:

 - `npm run audit`: Run phpcs audit
 - `npm run build`: Build css and js from sources
 - `npm run dev`: Watch css and js source dirs
 - `npm run dev-test`: create test fields in wp-admin and watch css and js source dirs
 - `npm run dashicons`: Generate dashicons scss variables from source
 - `npm run i18n`: generate `.pot` file
 - `npm run rollback`: remove last commit (local and remote  â€“ use with caution!)
 - `npm run test`: run unit tests against PHP 7.4 and 8.3
 - `npm run test:edge`: run unit tests against PHP 8.3 only
 - `npm run test:legacy`: run unit tests against PHP 7.4 only
 - `npm run uitest`: create test fields in wp-admin

Testing
-------
### In WP-Admin
Add some ACF Fields to several places for manual testing in wp-admin.
```shell
npm run dev-test
```

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are run in [wordpress/env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env/v/2.0.0), which is basically a docker container. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is required.

Unit tests are run against PHP 7.4 (legacy) and 8.3 (edge).  

**Run them all:**
```shell
npm run test
```

**Run edge tests only:**
```shell
npm run test:edge
```

**Configure edge test and run something in wp-cli in the docker container:**
```shell
npm run test:set-edge
npm run test:reset-env
wp-env run cli wp core version
> 6.7.1
```

**I could use a little help:**: 
 - Unit tests covering all PHP code
 - Unit-testing JS
